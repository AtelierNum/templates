## What hardware is needed ? ðŸ’¾ ðŸ”Œ

- an ESP32 dev board

## Software dependencies ðŸŒˆ ðŸ“‚

- the ESP32 related toolkit, [click here to see how to install it](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).

## How to run ? ðŸš€

You will have to first download and manually install the BLE_Keyboard libarary which you can't find with the Library Manager. To do this, download the library at //https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard and unzip it in your libraries folder. To know where your libraries folder is located you can go into `File > Preferences...` and look for "sketchbook location".

Then you can use your Arduino IDE to upload the code to your board.

## How to modify ? ðŸ”© ðŸ”¨

Honestly the code is really simple, just look at it.
