## What does it do ? ✨

This lets your ESP32 act as a keyboard communicating with your PC or phone through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

## What hardware is needed ? 💾 🔌

- an ESP32 dev board

## Software dependencies 🌈 📂

- the ESP32 related toolkit, [click here to see how to install it](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).

## How to run ? 🚀

You will have to first download and manually install the BLE_Keyboard libarary which you can't find with the Library Manager. To do this, download the library at //https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard and unzip it in your libraries folder. To know where your libraries folder is located you can go into `File > Preferences...` and look for "sketchbook location".

Then you can use your Arduino IDE to upload the code to your board.

## How to modify ? 🔩 🔨

Honestly the code is really simple, just look at it.

## Be Careful ⚠️

In this configuration both the ESP32 and the machine you'll connect on its network won't have access to the Internet.
