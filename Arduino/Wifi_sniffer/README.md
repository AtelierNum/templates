# Wifi sniffer

**Level** : ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Intermediate-yellow)

## What does it do ? âœ¨

This template uses a Esp8266 board to sniff all wifi enabled devices that are nearby.
You have basic arduino code, arduino code that communicates data via serial and processing code to visualize the data.

## What hardware is needed ? ðŸ’¾ ðŸ”Œ

- a esp8266 enabled board. (tested with feather esp8266 from adafruit)

## Software dependencies ðŸŒˆ ðŸ“‚

- arduino IDE
- you need to follow this guide to work with the feather 8266 in arduino IDE (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/using-arduino-ide)

## How to run ? ðŸš€

- upload the code to your arduino board.
- optionnaly run the processing code.

## How to modify ? ðŸ”© ðŸ”¨

- arduino code is self explanatory
- the processing code uses the **void serialEvent (Serial myPort) {}** function to receive the data from the board and fills up an ArrayList with unique devices.
- the **Device** stores the mac address, signal power and a timer value (for how long is it in the list) for each device.
