# RC522 presence detection

**Level** : ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Intermediate-yellow)

## What does it do ? âœ¨

This goes slightly beyond the basic example to keep detecting the tag or detecting there isn't a tag anymore. Because as it stands, the default examples only allow you to detect the arrival of a tag but not it's departure.

## What hardware is needed ? ðŸ’¾ ðŸ”Œ

- An arduino
- A RC522
- A computer

## Software dependencies ðŸŒˆ ðŸ“‚

- the arduino IDE

## How to run ? ðŸš€

- install the library for the RC522 from [https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)
  - use the green "Code" button to download the `.zip` of the project
  - in the arduino IDE use `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...`

## How to modify ? ðŸ”© ðŸ”¨

The provided `poll()` function will return 0 if there is no tag or the id of the tag as a 32bit unsigned integer.
