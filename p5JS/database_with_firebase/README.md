- Go to the firebase console.
- Create a new project
- Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/project/--{your-project-name}--/database/rules
  => set _'read'_ and _'write'_ parameters to _true_.
- Click on cog on the upper left hand side _"project overview"_ and choose _"projects settings"_
  => you'll fin at the bottom all the data you need to configure your access.

## Be Careful ⚠️

** Do as I say not as I do ! **

- When you edit the rules you put all your data readable and writable by eveyrone, this is not good and **you don't want to publish code like this.**
- Same goes for the data you have to fill-in to make this work : **don't publish it !**

The example here does register all the information needed to connect to a database (with api key etc), this is for the sake of showing what it looks like and having an example that works right out of the box But don't publish your credentials and api keys !
