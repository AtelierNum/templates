# Custom mouse cursor

**Level** : ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Beginner-brightgreen)

## What does it do ? âœ¨

This shows you how to change the cursor of your visitor to any image you'd like (although you probably should use a png with a transparent background);

## How to run ? ðŸš€

Like any html/css/js project, you could open the file straight from your file browser, or through a development server.

## How to modify ? ðŸ”© ðŸ”¨

The file is basically half comments. I trust you'll know what to do after reading them.
