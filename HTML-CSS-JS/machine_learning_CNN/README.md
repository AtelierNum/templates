## What is a CNN ?
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. 
Unlike a KNN (k-nearest neighbors). CNN is not a pre-trained model and may have a custom neural structure to meet a specific need.

## What does it do ? ✨
This template use :
-  [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/)
-  [Canvas_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
-  [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)

It is used to train a model and classify images that can come from a camera, video, image or a canvas (works with p5js).

## What hardware is needed ? 💾 🔌
- webcam

## How to run ? 🚀
You need a web server to take advantage of all the features and a compatible browser (hardware acceleration is highly recommended).

- Add data to the different class (you can add as many class as you want)
- Click on `Train` and wait
- You can save your model to avoid training it every time

## How to modify ? 🔩 🔨


You can modify the source of your model (video, image ..) in `cnn.js` by replacing the selected element in the` input` variable.

The rest of the code is self-explanatory and commented.

To modify the structure of the neural networks, I invite you to watch the videos of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPKsVAI_W6M&t=79s&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) and to experiment.
