# Minimal PWA

**Level** : ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Beginner-brightgreen)

![](readme_resources/og_thumbnail.jpg)

## What does it do ? âœ¨

This is the simplest PWA(Progressive Web App) starter possible. Everything in there is required to make it installable. Outside of that it's just a simple web page.

## Software dependencies ðŸŒˆ ðŸ“‚

None!

## How to run ? ðŸš€

It's just a dead simple web page. Run it with a development server. Although it will only be installable if you're accessing it through the "localhost" address or a HTTP**S** connexion.

## How to modify ? ðŸ”© ðŸ”¨

Just like any HTML/CSS/JS website

## Additional resources ðŸ“„ ðŸ“—

## How you could improve the template ðŸ¦¾

This most minimal approach doesn't even need a service worker. We would need one to make it work offline.
