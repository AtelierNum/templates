## What does it do ? âœ¨

This template allow you to put any number of audio elements onto your page and analyse them in realtime using the meyda library.

## What hardware is needed ? ðŸ’¾ ðŸ”Œ

- something to listen to your audio like headphones maybe?

## Software dependencies ðŸŒˆ ðŸ“‚

- Meyda.js but a frozen version (5.6) is prodived within the template

## How to run ? ðŸš€

Any solution which let's you run a small webserver will do, such as :

- a "live server" extension for your editor
- copying this project inside of the "HTML, CSS, & JS" template of replit.com (or codepen, or codesandbox, etc...)
- a small webserver (like express, flask, cowboy, etc...)

No code for visualising the collected data as been provided in order to make the code lighter. Just open the devtools (F12) when you are on the page.

## How to modify ? ðŸ”© ðŸ”¨

- the audios present on the page are defined in `index.html` and stored inside of `assets/audio`.
- the main code is inside of `script.js`
