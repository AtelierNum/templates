## What is a template?

Templates answers the question "How do I do X (with Y)?". An example would be "How do I create a web browser addon?" or "How do display AR experiences with A-Frame?"

The template should be working out of the box or require as few efforts as possible.

A template showcases exactly 1 thing.

A template could be used as the starting point of a project.

## How to document a template

Copy the "sub_readme_template.md" to the folder of your template and fill it.

You must comment at least the files mentionned in the section "How to start" and "How to modify".

## Submitting a template without being comfortable with Git or GitHub

If you have a cool template but you don't know how to submit it, please create an [issue](https://github.com/AtelierNum/templates/issues/new) and ping @zhakk-harn. You'll be guided through the process of submitting your code.
